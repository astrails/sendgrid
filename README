This is just envelop to send your emails via sendgrid (http://sendgrid.com/, http://wiki.sendgrid.com/doku.php?id=ruby_email).
All you need to do is define smtp settings, and pick a mailer that would send emails via sendgrid.

Plugin allows to keep your mailer(s) untouched, it takes the recipients list from "To:" header,
and generates appropriate X-Smtpapi header.

Usage:
1. define smtp settings as usual:

ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
  :address => "smtp.sendgrid.net",
  :port => '25',
  :domain => "mydomain.com",
  :authentication => :plain,
  :user_name => "my_sendgrid_username",
  :password => "my_sendgrid_password"
}

2. let's assume you have some 
class MyCoolEmailer < ActionMailer::Base
end

3. add to some initializers/mailer_patch.rb

MyCoolEmailer.send :include, SendGrid

4. outgoing emails will have X-Smtpapi taken from the "To" header generated by your MyCoolEmailer
